We Remade LogoFAIL and made it public

-------------------------------------
UPDATE
-------------------------------------
After significant team restructuring, the development of LogoFAIL is back on track. The current two .EXE files are merely placeholders, as we are completely rebuilding the project with improved functionality and proper implementation.

Important Note: Due to these changes, development is significantly behind schedule. We now anticipate releasing a demo or placeholder version between 2025 and 2026.

At this stage, you will need your own modified EFI file to use the build. However, we aim to eliminate this requirement before the demo release. -Nukerhugo

Shoutout to Binarly for original research
-----------------------------------------
LogoFAIL is a security exploit that allows binary code execution during the boot section. Our program tries to replicate that.
