# LogoFAIL: Project Update and Relaunch

---

### **UPDATE**

After undergoing a significant restructuring of our development team, we are happy to announce that the LogoFAIL project is back on track. The current two .EXE files are now placeholders, as we are completely rebuilding the project to enhance its functionality and ensure a more robust implementation.

**Important Note:** Due to these changes, development has been delayed. We now expect to release a demo or placeholder version sometime between **2025 and 2026**.

Currently, you will need a modified EFI file to use the build. However, we are actively working to remove this requirement before the demo release.
